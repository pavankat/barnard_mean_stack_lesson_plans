	- show how to invoke multiple functions on click
	- show how to add a class
	- show how to remove a class
	- show how to return false; on click of a link
	- show how to do a mouseenter mouseleave effect on an element

		- Show it all with 
			- example-2.html

You do - 10 minutes
	- exercise-2.html

I do - 2 minutes
	- show how to hide something and then show something

You do - 10 minutes
	- exercise-3.html

I do - 10 minutes
	talk about $(this) if looping over p tags in .each, if clicking on a div with p tags - if else

	grab the text of something and check if it's a value and alert to the screen if it is

You do - 10 minutes
	exercise-4.html

I do - 2 minutes
	parseInt for an integer in a string

	"1" + "1" = "11"

	parseInt("1") + parseInt("1") = 2

You do - 10 minutes
	exercise-5.html

I do 
	example-3.html 
		- go over forms, grabbing values from forms, form validation with JS

You do - 10 minutes
	exercise-6.html

I do 
	- show how to get the children of an element
		- use example-5.html

You do
	What does this return in the console?

	$('body').children();

I do 
	- remind students about reference

	//BY REFERENCE
		//oh, another thing that recently occured to me is that we need to talk about value vs reference because all of these vars that contain DOM objects are reference - that’s why you can change its properties and they change on screen

I do 
	- Creating elements
	- setting attributes of elements
	- adding elements to the document
	- removing elements from the document

		- use example-4.html to explain

You do
	- exercise-7.html

I do 
	//Data attributes in jQuery
	
	- use example-6.html

You do
	//in regards to example-6.html

	* show students the html after the "add another button above" link is clicked.

	* 
		show students how the other buttons still work

		show how the new button doesn't work

		show students how the javascript isn't even being executed with break points on 
			$('button').on('click', function(){ 
		and 
			after 
	* 

	//break students into groups with leaders - each group will come up with reasons
	//Question: why isn't the newly added button alerting the value in the data attribute

	//Answer: don't answer it do this. Let them make observations.

	* modify code to make it work *

		$( document ).on('click', 'button', function(){
			var part = $(this).data('tvshow');

			alert(part);
		});

	//Question for groups: why does it work now?

		//Answer: you know for sure the document exists - and you know for sure it did load - so since you're attaching the event to the document - it will work on any newly created buttons
