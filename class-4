	## Outline

	**Beginning** [10 mins]
	* Learning objectives on the board
	* Framing - why jQuery?

	## Lesson Plan

	#### Intro [10 mins]

	Framing:
	* Explain the purpose of jQuery as making our code easier to write and cross-browser compatible
	* Describe a library as a set of utilities/code that you can use for free!

	#### Demo [15 mins]

	1. Bring up some webpage and open the console.
	* Get a reference to an element using jQuery. Call `.text()` on it
	* Describe the difference. Highlight in jQuery we're calling functions...

	#### Exercise [10 mins]
	 * demonstrate the selector that is a string argument to $
	1. Grab all the `p` tags
	* Grab all of the elements with class `.muffin`
	* Grab an `h1`

	Review. 

	#### Groups [30 mins]

	Break the class into 6 groups. Assign each one of the following. Ask them to spend 5 minutes researching the jQuery docs to find the relevant code. No coding, just research. http://api.jquery.com/

	* reading the class of an element
	* appending an element
	* click event listener
	* setting an id
	* reading the input value
	* adding a class to an element

	Collect the answers from each group and write on the board.

	//Grabbing elements


	//Grabbing by name


	//Grabbing all by name

	//Getting things by class, by tag name and class, by tag name and inner tag name

	//In class exercise:
		//select all the p tags in a strong

		// <p>
		// 	<strong class='bands'>Backstreet Boys</strong>
		// </p>
		// <p>
		// 	<strong>cat</strong>
		// </p>
		// <p>
		// 	<strong class='bands'>N'Sync</strong>
		// </p>
		// <p>
		// 	<strong class='bands'>Five</strong>
		// </p>

	//CHILDREN
		<ul id="animalList">
			<li>hi</li>
			<li>thing</li>
			<li>thingie</li>
		</ul>
			
		var list = document.getElementById("animalList")

		list.children
			//what can I do with this now?
			//I can loop over it look for things that have an attribute equal to something and change that attribute based on other variables on the page

	//BY REFERENCE
		//oh, another thing that recently occured to me is that we need to talk about value vs reference because all of these vars that contain DOM objects are reference - that’s why you can change its properties and they change on screen

	//Getting and setting attributes of elements

	//Creating elements


	//Adding elements to the dom
			

	//Editing elements from the dom
		//- grab it from the dom
		//- edit the innerHTML

	//Deleting elements from the dom
