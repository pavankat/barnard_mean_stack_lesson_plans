	"1" + "1" = "11"

	parseInt("1") + parseInt("1") = 2

You do - 10 minutes
	exercise-5.html

You do - 10 minutes
	exercise-6.html

I do 
	//CHILDREN
		<ul id="animalList">
			<li>hi</li>
			<li>thing</li>
			<li>thingie</li>
		</ul>
			
		var list = $("#animalList")

		list.children
			//what can I do with this now?
			//I can loop over it look for things that have an attribute equal to something and change that attribute based on other variables on the page


You do
	What does this return in the console?

	$('body').children();

I do 
	- remind students about reference

	//BY REFERENCE
		//oh, another thing that recently occured to me is that we need to talk about value vs reference because all of these vars that contain DOM objects are reference - thatâ€™s why you can change its properties and they change on screen

//need some kind of exercise for this
I do 
	//Creating elements and setting attributes of elements
		var div1 = $("<div/>");

		div1.html('<p>stuff</p>'); //remind class that this method can be used to edit an element that already exists in the document too

		div1.attr('id', 'firstDiv'); //remind class that this method can be used to edit an element that already exists in the document too

		div1.appendTo(body); //goes to the end 
			//to put it in the beginning, there's a function called prepend

		div1.appendTo( $( "#container" ) ); //adds element to the document

		To create a HTML element, $("<div/>") or $("<div></div>") is preferred. Then you can use either appendTo , append , before , after and etc,. to insert the new element to the DOM. I would recommend the first option, where you actually build elements using jQuery.May 16, 2012
			
	//Deleting elements from the dom
		$('#titanic').remove();

	//Data attributes in jQuery
	$('.toggle img').data('block', 'something');
