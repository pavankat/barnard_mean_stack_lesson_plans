//Objectives:
// 1. students will understand how to use constructor functions to create objects.
// 2. students will understand be able to identify what a variable equals to based on JavaScript Scope.
// 3. students will understand how the window and document works in js
// 4. students will be able to use jQuery to make their webpages interactive
// 5. students will be ready to do their first project for this class - a game 

//window/document, jQuery, first project given

//I DO - 5 minutes

		For those who don't remember (or choose to forget), Tamagotchis were "digital pets" that you could carry around with you and feed them, clean up after them, pet them, and try to keep them happy.

		Make a Tamagotchi constructor. Give it the following properties:
		1. a hungry property (initially false)
		2. a sick property (initially false)
		3. an age of 0

		and give it the following methods:

		feed() - if hungry is true, print "That was yummy!" and set hungry to false. If hungry is false, print "No thanks, I'm full." and set hungry to true.
		sleep() - prints out "zzzzzzz" (use as many z's as you want)
		medicate() - if sick is true, print "I feel much better!" and set sick to false. If sick is false, print "No thanks, I feel fine." and set sick to true.
		increaseAge() - increase the age by one and print "Happy Birthday to me! I am " + age + " years old!"
		Now make a variable named dog that is set to a new Tamagotchi.

		Add the following methods to it:
		1. bark() - prints out "ruff ruff
		2. goOutside() - prints out "I own that tree now!"

		Make a variable named cat that is set to a new Tamagotchi. Add the following methods to it:
		1. meow() - prints out "Meow!"
		2. useLitterBox() - "Burried treasure!"

//SCOPE "it always goes up in JS" -> lexical scope

//I DO - 3 minutes

	//me: when the doSomething function executes - JS looks for the hamsterName variable inside the function - if it doesn't find it then it looks one level above it. It finds it right above it

	//me: *** comment out var hamsterName = 'chuck'; ***

	//engage everyone: think in your head what happens when this executes

	//me: the code fails but what happened? the doSomething function executes, JS looks for hamsterName inside the doSomething function, it doesn't find it, so it goes up one level and it doesn't find it and it throws an error that we're using an undefined variable


//I DO - 3 minutes

	//Global means the variable was declared outside of any functions. Global variables can be used anywhere in your code.

	//engage everyone: explain to your partner why "this is global too" alerts to the screen

	//me: when you don't include var in front of a variable - it forces it to be global - no matter where you put it. It's a best practice to always put var in front of your variables to avoid this. However, in some cases you want a function to over ride a global variable's value. It's important to try your best to avoid this.

	//engage everyone: what if I take out go(); Will this work? No because that line of code needs to execute for the variable to be made globally available.

//You do - 1 minute - explain to your partner what the difference is between these two variables 
	var wearingSunglasses = true; 
	wearingDesignerShoes = false; 

	//answer : nothing - they're both global because they're outside a function - the first one is more proper - but they both essentially are the same because they're ___________ (let them finish this: outside a function).

//WINDOW/DOCUMENT

//I do - 10 minutes

		think in your head now - don't answer - what is the window based on the dot structure above?

			- it's an object
	*/

//You do - 1 minute
	/*
		answer in your head - not outloud - what's alert in respect to the window?
			- it's a key of the window object and that key points to a function
			- what does it do?
				- it alerts to the screen
	*/

//I do - 5 minutes
	//when you do 
		var catName = 'whiskers'

		function giveMeABand(){
			console.log('hi')
		}

		window.giveMeABand();

	//The window has properties like
		// - innerWidth
		// - innerHeight
			// - if console is open it affects the height 

		// but here's something crazy 
			//where are we right now - we are in a universe 

//You do - 1 minute
	// * type this *

	//AS FRONT END JS developers - your javascript lives in what universe? _____ - talk about it with your partners - right it down
		
		// Answer: the window is your universe


// I do - 10 minutes
	
	// The document is in the window

	// - what is the document - it's all your html
		// 	- converted into a javascript object
		
// One Does - Cold Call

	window.document

	//is this the same as

	document

	//it is because, when you say document, js just attaches it to the window. Why? 

// I do - 10 minutes

	document.title // get's the document's title

	document.body // get's the document's body


	//DOM = document object model
		//Document
			//Element -> html
				//-> Element -> head

		list.children
			//what can I do with this now?
			//I can loop over it look for things that have an attribute equal to something and change that attribute based on other variables on the page



	//BY REFERENCE
		//oh, another thing that recently occured to me is that we need to talk about value vs reference because all of these vars that contain DOM objects are reference - that’s why you can change its properties and they change on screen

	//Getting and setting attributes of elements

	//Creating elements


	//Adding elements to the dom
			

	//Editing elements from the dom
		//- grab it from the dom
		//- edit the innerHTML

	//Deleting elements from the dom


jQuery
	- get ga stuff
	- give a guide of the commands for javascript and what they are in jQuery for student reference
	- why use it -> mobile browser differences - they've accounted for - if you use the cdn - most people have it cached already - so your page will be faster
	- people who do DOM things in straight jav

	- on cick is important, on key press important
