	/*
		For those who don't remember (or choose to forget), Tamagotchis were "digital pets" that you could carry around with you and feed them, clean up after them, pet them, and try to keep them happy.

		Make a Tamagotchi constructor. Give it the following properties:
		1. a hungry property (initially false)
		2. a sick property (initially false)
		3. an age of 0

		and give it the following methods:

		feed() - if hungry is true, print "That was yummy!" and set hungry to false. If hungry is false, print "No thanks, I'm full." and set hungry to true.
		sleep() - prints out "zzzzzzz" (use as many z's as you want)
		medicate() - if sick is true, print "I feel much better!" and set sick to false. If sick is false, print "No thanks, I feel fine." and set sick to true.
		increaseAge() - increase the age by one and print "Happy Birthday to me! I am " + age + " years old!"
		Now make a variable named dog that is set to a new Tamagotchi.

		Add the following methods to it:
		1. bark() - prints out "ruff ruff
		2. goOutside() - prints out "I own that tree now!"

		Make a variable named cat that is set to a new Tamagotchi. Add the following methods to it:
		1. meow() - prints out "Meow!"
		2. useLitterBox() - "Burried treasure!"

//SCOPE "it always goes up in JS" -> lexical scope

//I DO - 3 minutes

	//me: when the doSomething function executes - JS looks for the hamsterName variable inside the function - if it doesn't find it then it looks one level above it. It finds it right above it

	//me: *** comment out var hamsterName = 'chuck'; ***

	//engage everyone: think in your head what happens when this executes

	//me: the code fails but what happened? the doSomething function executes, JS looks for hamsterName inside the doSomething function, it doesn't find it, so it goes up one level and it doesn't find it and it throws an error that we're using an undefined variable

	//Global means the variable was declared outside of any functions. Global variables can be used anywhere in your code.

	//engage everyone: explain to your partner why "this is global too" alerts to the screen

	//me: when you don't include var in front of a variable - it forces it to be global - no matter where you put it. It's a best practice to always put var in front of your variables to avoid this. However, in some cases you want a function to over ride a global variable's value. It's important to try your best to avoid this.

	//engage everyone: what if I take out go(); Will this work? No because that line of code needs to execute for the variable to be made globally available.

//You do - 1 minute - explain to your partner what the difference is between these two variables 
	var wearingSunglasses = true; 
	wearingDesignerShoes = false; 

	//answer : nothing - they're both global because they're outside a function - the first one is more proper - but they both essentially are the same because they're ___________ (let them finish this: outside a function).
